# Class-27
This contains the files that were edited and coded in the class 27 in WhitehatJR Pro Course. It is the third stage of the angry birds game. It has everything same as the repository 'Class-25' but in this the slingshot has been created using "Matter.js - CONSTRAINTS" and the code is made more easy, short and clear. It is coded in javascript using "matter.js". To change the logic, edit the code in the file 'sketch.js' file.
